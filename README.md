# Amazon_clone
HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT is used to create this amazon clone. Made changes in the icons, search tab, themes, fonts and overall look (enough to make it little distinguishable from that of the original website).
Added functions to the hello sign-in option on the main page to efficiently register the user email id and password.
Added js function to check whether the user email is a valid email or not as well as an added function to check whether the password is typed or not entered.
Customized the Sign-in age and the Password page to look like original Amazon Sign-in page.
